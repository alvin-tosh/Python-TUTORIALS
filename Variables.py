# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

x = 4           # x is of type int
x = "Sally"     # x is now of type str
print(x)        # Output: Sally
