# In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False. 
# You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
# When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer

print(10 > 9)  # True
print(10 == 9) # False 
print(10 < 9)  # False



# The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return.
x = "Hello"
y = 15

print(bool(x)) # True
print(bool(y)) # True
