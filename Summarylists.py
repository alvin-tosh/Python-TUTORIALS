# Summary or rather --- Python lists Cheat sheet ---

    # A list is an ordered collection of items.
  
    # Use square bracket notation [] to access a list element by its index. The first element has an index 0.
    
    # Use a negative index to access a list element from the end of a list. The last element has an index -1.
    
    # Use list[index] = new_value to modify an element from a list.
    
    # Use append() to add a new element to the end of a list.
    
    # Use insert() to add a new element at a position in a list.
    
    # Use pop() to remove an element from a list and return that element.
    
    # Use remove() to remove an element from a list.
