# A list is an ordered collection of items.
# Python uses the square brackets ([]) to indicate a list. The following shows an empty list:

empty_list = []

# Typically, a list contains one or more items. 
# To separate two items, you use a comma (,). For example:

todo_list = ['Learn Python List','How to manage List elements']

# Since a list often contains many items, it’s a good practice to name it using plural nouns e.g., numbers, colors, and shopping_carts.
# The following example defines a list of six numbers:

numbers = [1, 3, 2, 7, 9, 4]
# If you print out the list, you’ll see its representation including the square brackets...

print(numbers)
# Output:
# [1, 3, 2, 7, 9, 4]


# The following shows how to define a list of strings...

colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
print(colors)

# Output
# ['red', 'green', 'blue']
