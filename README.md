# :cherries:Applications of Python

As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:

    1. Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.

    2. Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.

    3. Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.

    4. A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

    5. Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.

    6. Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.

    7. Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

    8. Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

    9. Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

    10. Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
