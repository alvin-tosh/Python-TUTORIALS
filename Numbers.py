# There are three numeric types in Python; Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them

x = 1     # int or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
y = 2.8   # float or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
a = 35e3  # Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10
z = 1j    # complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part

# To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
